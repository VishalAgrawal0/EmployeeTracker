EmployeeTracker using Spring boot ::   

EmployeeTracker is a Java Spring Boot application designed to manage employee records efficiently. 
This project provides a RESTful API that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data. 
The application is built using the Spring Boot framework, leveraging its capabilities for creating scalable, production-ready applications with ease.

Key features of EmployeeTracker include:
Create: Add new employee records to the database with relevant details such as name, role, department, and contact information.
Read: Retrieve detailed information about individual employees or lists of employees using filtering and sorting options.
Update: Modify existing employee records to reflect changes in roles, contact details, or other personal information.
Delete: Remove employee records from the database when they are no longer needed.

EmployeeTracker ensures data consistency and integrity by employing proper validation and exception handling mechanisms. 
It uses H2 dependency as in memory database interactions, and uses JpaRepository class for repository operations.

Designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, EmployeeManager is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses seeking an effective solution to manage employee information.
